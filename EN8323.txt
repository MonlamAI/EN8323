Thoughts on Slavery in Tibet. 

In recent weeks, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has intensified its efforts to spread propaganda about Tibet and the Dalai Lama. The CCP-controlled Global Times newspaper is one of the main outlets for this propaganda, and two of the most prominent claims they make are about the alleged slavery system in Tibet before 1950 and the supposed responsibility of the Dalai Lama for this system.




Firstly, on the one hand, the Chinese government claims that Tibet always belonged to China before 1950, and on the other hand, they claim the Dalai Lama is responsible for the inhumane treatment of ordinary Tibetans in the supposed slavery system that existed before 1950s. If thatâ€™s true, China should take full responsibility for in human treatment in Tibet as it claims ownership of Tibet at that time! (H.H. the 14th Dalai Lama took political leadership of Tibet only after 1950). 

In reality, there was no so-called slavery system in Tibet before 1950. Tibetan society had its own social hierarchy and class system, but it was not based on slavery. The terms "miser" (subject) and "pon" (master/leader) were used to describe social status, but ordinary people owned their land and were free to travel as long as they paid taxes (can be in the form of labour during harvest season). They could even sell their farms, which is evidenced by the fact that Yogi Milarepa's mother sold her farm to pay for his studies.

The miser and pon system is fundamentally different from the slavery system, which involves the ownership of people as property, the denial of freedom, and the prohibition of free travel outside of a certain area. The fact that from the 5th Dalai Lama to current Dalai Lama were born into peasant families and rose to the position of head of state also contradicts the claim of a slavery system in Tibet.

Furthermore, the majority of regents, Tripa[s] (head of the monastery), Rinpoches, and monk officials in the Tibetan government came from peasant or nomadic backgrounds. This is a clear indication that the old Tibetan system was not based on slavery.

In conclusion, the Chinese propaganda claiming the existence of a slavery system in Tibet before 1950 is inaccurate and unsupported by historical evidence. The terms "miser" and "pon" describe social status in Tibetan society, but ordinary people owned their land and were free to travel. The rise of the Dalai Lama and other officials from peasant or nomadic backgrounds further disproves the claim of a slavery system in Tibet. It is important to approach historical claims with critical analysis and to rely on evidence-based research to avoid spreading misinformation and propaganda.
